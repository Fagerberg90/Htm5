                                        for professional surfers, with waves from 1 to 3 meters with long
                                        break points.Surf spots can be accessed in two ways: by safari boats
                                        rented by groups of surfers, and by a dhoni transferring people from
                                        the resorts. Of course not all the spots can be accessed from the resorts.

                                        is famous for its splendid white beaches, crystal clear lagoons and

                                        are made into 20 by the government. This small republic was a kingdom
                                        before it was declared a republic. The population is estimated 265,000

                        <p>
                            The Maldives consists of 1,192 coral islands grouped in a double chain of 26 atolls, along
                            the north-south direction, spread over roughly 90,000 square kilometres (35,000 sq mi), making
                            this one of the world's most dispersed countries. It lies between latitudes 1°S and 8°N, and
                            longitudes 72° and 74°E. The atolls are composed of live coral reefs and sand bars, situated atop
                            a submarine ridge 960 kilometres (600 mi) long that rises abruptly from the depths of the Indian
                            Ocean and runs north to south. Only near the southern end of this natural coral barricade do two
                            open passages permit safe ship navigation from one side of the Indian Ocean to the other through
                            the territorial waters of Maldives. For administrative purposes the Maldivian government organised
                            these atolls into twenty one administrative divisions. The largest island of Maldives is Gan, which
                            belongs to Laamu Atoll or Hahdhummathi Maldives. In Addu Atoll the westernmost islands are connected
                            by roads over the reef (collectively called Link Road) and the total length of the road is 14 km (9 mi).

                            Maldives is the lowest country in the world, with maximum and average natural ground levels of only
                            2.4 metres (7 ft 10 in) and 1.5 metres (4 ft 11 in) above sea level, respectively. In areas where
                            construction exists, however, this has been increased to several metres. More than 80 per cent of the
                            country's land is composed of coral islands which rise less than one metre above sea level.[54] As a result,
                            the Maldives are at high risk of being submerged due to rising sea levels. The UN's environmental panel
                            has warned that, at current rates, sea level rise would be high enough to make the Maldives uninhabitable

                            The Maldives remained largely unknown to tourists until the early 1970s. Only 185 islands are home
                            to its 300,000 inhabitants. The other islands are used entirely for economic purposes, of which
                            tourism and agriculture are the most dominant. Tourism accounts for 28% of the GDP and more than
                            60% of the Maldives' foreign exchange receipts. Over 90% of government tax revenue comes from import duties

                        <p>
                            and tourism-related taxes. The development of tourism fostered the overall growth of the country's economy.
                            It created direct and indirect employment and income generation opportunities in other related industries.
                            The first tourist resorts were opened in 1972 with Bandos island resort and Kurumba Village (the current name
                            is Kurumba Maldives),[89] which transformed the Maldives economy. The resort island of Landaa Giraavaru (Baa atoll)
                            According to the Ministry of Tourism, the emergence of tourism in 1972 transformed the economy, moving rapidly
                            from dependence on fisheries to tourism. In just three and a half decades, the industry became the main source
                            of income. Tourism was also the country's biggest foreign currency earner and the single largest contributor to
                            the GDP. As of 2008, 89 resorts in the Maldives offered over 17,000 beds and hosted over 600,000 tourists annually.[90]
                            The number of resorts increased from 2 to 92 between 1972 and 2007. As of 2007, over 8,380,000 tourists had visited
                            Maldives.[91] Visitors to Maldives do not need to apply for a visa pre-arrival.
